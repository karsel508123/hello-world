# hello-world
i am learning github

Dear all,

This is Karma. I am interested to learn about github.  I would like to learn following:
1. Create and use a repository
2. Start and manage a new branch
3. Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits
4. Open and merge a pull request

I hope i will be able to learn within 3 minutes

Thanks
Karma
